Football Simulator: Total System Loop

PHASE I: INITIALIZATION
	1. Initialize the database.
	2. Generate and evaluate the schedule for the first season year.
	3. Go to PHASE II.
	
PHASE II: GAMEPLAY
	1. Select the next game to be played.
	2. Initalize base parameters and team strength estimates.
	3. Do a coin toss - just pick the team who possesses first in the first half by choosing a random number between 0 and 1 and see if it's less than 0.5 (home team to go first) or greater-than-or-equal-to (away team to go first). Remember who gets the second-half kickoff.
	4. Go to DECISION I in the Gameplay Decision Tree for the first team to possess and run the gameplay. A single play will have at least one decision/outcome pair, but may have multiple.
	5. Run plays until the end of the first half, then go to DECISION I for the second team. Run plays until the end of the fourth quarter.
	6. If the game is tied, start an overtime period and follow the OT rules in Outer Game Logic. Another coin toss is needed and works the same. In the playoffs, should a game reach 3OT, 5OT, or any odd-numbered OT, a new coin toss is required.
	7. The result of the game is recorded and the next game is selected to play, go to step 1.

PHASE III: PLAYOFFS
	1. After all regular season games are played, records are tallied and ties are broken to determine the playoffs:
		- The winners of the 5 divisions in each conference are in, along with the 3 teams in each conference who remain and have the highest ranking amongst teams in their conference.
		- The 5 division winners get the 1 through 5 seeds in order of their ranking amongst other division winners. Wild cards get 6 through 8 in the same manner.
		- The playoff games are as follows:
			- AFC Wild Card 1: #8 @ #1
			- AFC Wild Card 2: #7 @ #2
			- AFC Wild Card 3: #6 @ #3
			- AFC Wild Card 4: #5 @ #4
			- NFC Wild Card 1: #8 @ #1
			- NFC Wild Card 2: #7 @ #2
			- NFC Wild Card 3: #6 @ #3
			- NFC Wild Card 4: #5 @ #4
			- AFC Divisional Round 1: (lowest remaining seed) @ (highest remaining seed)
			- AFC Divisional Round 2: (second lowest seed) @ (second highest seed)
			- NFC Divisional Round 1: (lowest remaining seed) @ (highest remaining seed)
			- NFC Divisional Round 2: (second lowest seed) @ (second highest seed)
			- AFC Championship: (lowest remaining seed) @ (highest remaining seed)
			- NFC Championship: (lowest remaining seed) @ (highest remaining seed)
			- Super Bowl: (AFC winner) vs. (NFC Winner)
		- The designated home team in the Super Bowl is the AFC in even-numbered years and the NFC in odd-numbered years. The actual stadium is any of the 40 chosen at random.
		- Wild Card games are played on the Saturday and Sunday after Week 17, 4 games at 4:25pm and 4 games at 8:20pm, 4 per night.
		- Divisional Round games are played on the next Saturday and Sunday, 2 games at 4:25pm and 2 games at 8:20pm, 2 per night.
		- Conference Championship games are played on that next Sunday, the AFC game at 4:25pm and the NFC at 8:20pm.
		- The Super Bowl is played two weeks later on that Sunday, at 6:05pm.
	2. Create and save the game records for the Wild Card round and then play all the games as in PHASE II.
	3. Once the Wild Card round is over, create and save the game records for the Divisional Round games, then play them all as in PHASE II.
	4. Then do the Conference Championship in the same manner.
	5. Then do the Super Bowl.

		3-4. Conference championship losers in reverse ranking
		5-8. Divisional round losers in reverse ranking
		9-16. Wild Card round losers in reverse ranking
